又是比较辛苦的一天。

发现最近自己总是在学习思考AI方面的东西，昨晚闲着无聊，翻消息时又看到学院在明天下午4点有一个讲座，虽然在3：45之前我完全忘了这件事情，但也不影响最后我在4：01分赶到会场。可能是刚开学，这次听讲座的人出奇的多，以至于第二会场都满满当当。虽然讲座还是意料之中的无聊，但在快要结束的最后，有一句话忽然让整个讲座充满意义。

“其实AI研究的最前沿已经不再是学校了，而是企业。”

这句话突然点醒了我。最近，一直苦恼于找不到“最前沿”的研究，学校里的AI Agent、具身智能，都已经有相当多的人在研究。在AI发展呈现指数速度的现在，或许只要一两年，甚至几个月，这些现在看上去最新的研究方向，就会成为历史。正是源于此，实验室的课题对我来说仿佛就失去了吸引力---谁会去研究这些很快成为历史的东西呢？今天的这句话忽然让我醒悟，是啊，学校已经不再是最前沿了，真正那些充满着幻想的idea都是在企业中诞生！

这样想来，我们现在学习、研究，真正的意义在于何处？既然触摸不到那些此时此刻正在或者将要成为现实的idea，我们研究的意义在于何处？

我想，学校里应该研究那些真正crazy、unbelivable的事情，就像颠覆deeplearning，革新transformer，还有那些只存在于想象之中的理论，而不是自己去train一个模型，搭一个工程。昨晚回寝室，突然有翻到了早在2023年，CMU和Princeton的团队就提出了可能超越transformer的Mamba模型，对此产生了深深的敬意，忽然觉得这次才是一个大学应该做的事。或者像Google的DeepMind一样，充满梦想与勇气，拓展AI“智能”的边界，把遥远的星空作为目标。我们的大学，应当充满哲学与想象力。

而作为学生的我们，又应该怎样学习？我想，我们现在总是理论太多，实践太少。学一门课也不过是考考试，16周后出个成绩就作罢。很少能把学到的知识用到实践中去，也很少有人会这么想。但这恰恰是有意义的工作所需要的。在计算机的大家都在争夺高绩点的现在，或许提升自己的能力，加深自己的思想，多与实际项目联系，才是真正适合未来的选择。

刚刚欣赏了Mamba的原始论文，虽然一点都看不懂，但其实这也不过是两个研究生写的文章。忽然又感觉自己离这些great men之间的差距有多大。在听讲座时，去AI了一下DeepMind的招聘要求，诚如AI所说：“他们需要的是天才中的天才”，想想我自己，距离这些“天才”有多远呢？我也不知道自己能走多远，但我只愿听从自己的内心，这就够了。

ps:之前有朋友问我怎么不更新主页了，这让我很惊讶，没想到还有人在关注我的小破站。之前总是推脱，说假期太忙了（其实就是懒）。现在开学了，虽然更忙，也努力抽出一些时间来写写。谢谢大家，你们的关系是我前进的动力，希望我的生活也能给你们带来温暖。

It was another rather exhausting day.

I realized that lately I’ve been constantly learning and thinking about AI-related topics. Last night, when I was bored and scrolling through messages, I saw that the college had a lecture scheduled for 4:00 p.m. today. I had completely forgotten about it until 3:45, but still managed to rush to the venue and arrive at 4:01. Maybe because the semester just started, the number of attendees was surprisingly high—so much so that even the overflow hall was packed. As expected, the lecture itself was dull, but near the very end, one sentence suddenly gave the entire event meaning:

“In fact, the real frontier of AI research is no longer in schools, but in companies.”

That sentence woke me up. Recently, I’ve been troubled by the feeling that I couldn’t find the “cutting edge” of research. In universities, topics like AI Agents and embodied intelligence are already being explored by many people. With AI developing at an exponential pace, it might take only a year—or even just a few months—before today’s “new” directions become history. Because of that, lab projects feel less appealing to me. Who would want to study something destined to be obsolete so soon? But today’s sentence made me realize: yes, schools are no longer the forefront. The truly imaginative ideas are being born in companies!

Thinking this way, I can’t help but wonder: what is the true meaning of our learning and research now? Since we can’t directly touch those ideas that are becoming or will soon become reality, what is the point of our work?

I think universities should explore things that are truly crazy and unbelievable—like overturning deep learning, reinventing transformers, or proposing theories that exist only in imagination—rather than just training a model or building a system. Last night in my dorm, I stumbled upon the fact that as early as 2023, teams from CMU and Princeton had already proposed the Mamba model, which might surpass transformers. I felt deep respect for that and thought: this is exactly what a university should be doing. Or like Google’s DeepMind—full of dreams and courage, pushing the boundaries of “intelligence” in AI, aiming at the distant stars. Our universities should be filled with philosophy and imagination.

And as students, how should we learn? I think we now have too much theory and too little practice. Taking a course is usually just about passing an exam and getting a grade after 16 weeks, nothing more. Rarely do we apply what we learn to real practice, and even fewer people think to do so. But that’s exactly what meaningful work requires. While everyone in computer science is competing for high GPAs, perhaps the better choice for the future is to improve our actual abilities, deepen our thinking, and connect more with real projects.

I just finished reading the original Mamba paper. I couldn’t really understand it, but after all, it was just written by two graduate students. Suddenly I realized the huge gap between myself and those “great men.” During the lecture, I even asked AI about DeepMind’s hiring requirements, and as AI said: “They need geniuses among geniuses.” Thinking about myself, I wonder how far I am from those “geniuses.” I don’t know how far I can go, but I only wish to follow my heart—that’s enough.

P.S. A friend once asked me why I stopped updating my homepage. I was surprised—didn’t expect anyone was still following my little site. I always made excuses, saying I was too busy during the holidays (truth is, just lazy). Now that the semester has started, I’m even busier, but I’ll try to spare some time to write. Thank you all—your attention is my motivation to keep going. I also hope my life can bring you some warmth.
