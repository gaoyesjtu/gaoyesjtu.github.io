随着新学期的到来，我也算是正式开始进入人工智慧的研究中了。换了一个名词，是因为就像“神经网络”一样，“人工智能”这个词已经被用得太多，不知不觉间，竟悄悄地流失了最初的意味。就像一个人慢慢长大，就渐渐丢失了童年的模样。无论是什么类型的公司，无论是哪个专业的大学生，一直到街上的来来往往的普通人，每一个人都在谈论 AI，谈论人工智慧。

我时常会问自己：“我为什么选择这个专业，为什么研究这个领域？”我也不得不承认，我的初心也只是为了赚钱，为了好专业，为了好大学，于是义无反顾地跳进了这条河流。时至今日，在这条路上越走越深，体会也越来越多，回首最初的那个聪明而幼稚的决定，心中渐渐五味杂陈。看着现在各行各业的学生都转向这个“最热门”的行业，开启这个时代的淘金之旅，我也总在想，他们中又有多少跟我怀有同样的初心？这么久以来，我总是太功利，太不真诚，我也仅仅是把人工智慧当成一种谋生的手段，而没有真正地去认识她，理解她。我一直都是那么不自信，模仿别人的生活，盲从别人的意见。

在这个狂热的时代里，我们应当真诚地对待人工智慧，我应当真诚地对待她。在功利中生活，我不快乐，或许最后我能得到我想要的，但这一路走来，似乎太缺少风景。进实验室，发论文，得高绩点，保研，出国，高薪工作，写作……这些我已“清晰规划”好的目标，到底是不是生活的全部？这些日子里，我一直很拼，但我是否真的快乐呢？我是否真的感受到知识的美好，还是只把它当成日后应对工作的一种技能呢？

这样想来，我还远远没有真正进入人工智慧的研究，我还没有足够真诚，但至少，旅途才刚刚开始。

补：上海的气候还是不同于家乡。今天是上海最后的夏日，故乡已经入秋多时了。

With the arrival of the new semester, I can say that I have officially begun my journey into the study of artificial intelligence. I prefer to call it “artificial wisdom,” because just like the term “neural networks,” the word “artificial intelligence” has been used so much that, without us realizing, it has quietly lost its original meaning. It’s like a person growing up—slowly losing the face of childhood. No matter the type of company, the major of a university student, or the ordinary people walking the streets—everyone is talking about AI, talking about artificial wisdom.

I often ask myself: Why did I choose this major? Why study this field? I must admit, my original intention was just to make money, to get into a good major, a good university—so I jumped into this river without hesitation. To this day, as I go deeper down this road, my reflections grow richer. Looking back at that smart yet naïve decision, my heart is filled with mixed emotions. Seeing students from all fields now flocking to this “hottest” industry, joining the gold rush of this era, I wonder: how many of them share the same original intention as I did? For so long, I’ve been too utilitarian, too insincere. I have treated artificial wisdom merely as a means of livelihood, without truly trying to know her, to understand her. I’ve always lacked confidence—imitating others’ lives, blindly following others’ opinions.

In this feverish age, we ought to approach artificial wisdom sincerely. I must approach her sincerely. Living only for utility, I am not happy. Perhaps in the end I will achieve what I want, but along the way, the scenery seems too sparse. Entering the lab, publishing papers, achieving a high GPA, securing graduate admission, going abroad, getting a high-paying job, writing… I have “clearly planned” all these goals. But are they really the entirety of life? Lately, I’ve been working very hard, but am I truly happy? Do I really feel the beauty of knowledge, or do I just treat it as a skill to use for future work?

Thinking this way, I realize I am still far from truly entering the study of artificial wisdom. I am not sincere enough yet. But at the very least—the journey has only just begun.

Postscript: The climate in Shanghai is still different from my hometown. Today marks the last summer day in Shanghai, while my hometown has long entered autumn.
