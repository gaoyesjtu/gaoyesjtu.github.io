今天是建立小站的第二天，虽然昨晚 2:30 才睡，依然不妨碍今天特种兵式地工作。

将小站里的家具大换，只保留了 dairys、projects 和 CV。调整了夜间模式的配色，并且增加了中英转化的功能（花费了我 5 个小时！！！一直 debug，一直 404，最后发现好像是缩进错了...）。晚间一边工作，一边跟好朋友聊天，“西方有石名黛，可代画眉之墨”，钗黛终有合一的一天。

由于今天开始决定要录制视频，一边录视频一边工作确实很不习惯，写 about 的时候紧张得字都打不出来了，真不是块做 blogger 的料...

Today is the second day of building my little site. Although I didn’t go to bed until 2:30 last night, it still didn’t stop me from working like a “special forces soldier” today.

I rearranged the furniture of the site, keeping only dairys, projects, and CV. I adjusted the night mode color scheme and added the Chinese-English switching feature (it took me 5 hours!!! debugging non-stop, kept hitting 404, and finally realized it was probably just a wrong indentation...). In the evening, I worked while chatting with a good friend: “In the West there is a stone called Dai, which can replace ink for painting eyebrows.” One day, Dai and Chai will eventually come together.

Since today I decided to start recording videos, doing video recording and working at the same time really felt uncomfortable. When writing the about page, I was so nervous that I couldn’t even type properly. Clearly, I’m not cut out to be a blogger...

Summer night, rain against the window.
