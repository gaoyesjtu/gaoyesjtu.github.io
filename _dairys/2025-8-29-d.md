今天是建小站的最后一天，全力以赴地冲刺。大约在下午三点左右完成了最后的编辑，只剩下剪视频了。

今天是七夕节，却依然坚持工作，虽然一个人，但一点都不觉得寂寞，或许是我心中充满了希望吧。不知为何，今天的天气凉爽怡人，一点都不像夏天。用这首诗作结吧。

&nbsp;

夏日

里尔克

主啊，是时候了。夏天盛极一时。

把你的阴影置于日晷上，

让风吹过牧场。

让枝头最后的果实饱满。

再给两天南方的好天气，

催它们成熟，把最后的甘甜压进浓酒。

谁此时没有房子，就不必建造，

谁此时孤独，就永远孤独，

就醒来，读书，写长长的信，

在林荫路上不停地，

徘徊，落叶纷飞。

夏日 午后

Today is the last day of building this little site, pushing forward with all my strength. Around three o’clock in the afternoon, I finished the final edits, with only the video cutting left to do.

Today is Qixi Festival, yet I still keep working. Although I am alone, I don’t feel lonely at all—perhaps because my heart is full of hope. For some reason, the weather today is cool and pleasant, not like summer at all. Let me end with this poem.

**Summer**

Rainer Maria Rilke

Lord, it is time. The summer was magnificent.  

Lay your shadow on the sundials,  
and let loose the winds upon the fields.  

Command the last fruits to be full;  
give them two more southern days,  
urge them to completion and drive  
the last sweetness into the heavy wine.  

Whoever has no house now, will never build one.  
Whoever is alone now, will long remain so,  
will stay awake, read, write long letters,  
and wander the boulevards up and down,  
restlessly, while the leaves are drifting.
